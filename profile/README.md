# Hello

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan, I'm a software engineer and tinkerer living on the Ã…land Islands.

I make stuff for my enjoyment or for your profit, build keyboards and do
embedded systems development in C and C++. I've done huge monoliths in Java,
slick [12 Factor Web Apps](https://12factor.net/) in any mix of JavaScript, Ruby
and SQL.

I do a lot of translations into Swedish too, Mastodon and Tusky are my current
guilty pleasures, Microsoft MakeCode and Khan Academy before that as well as a
bunch of other projects during the years.
